      <p>Olá!</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m a software engineer with 12 years of experience. I&rsquo;ve started my career when I was <strong>12</strong>, playing around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating small websites for companies in my hometown in the country-side of Brazil. Soon, I fell in love with dynamic&nbsp;languages like PHP. I also had a crush with <strong>graphic design</strong>.</p>
      <p>In 2004 I went to a <strong>technical</strong> school where I learned hardware and programming languages like Delphi and C++. After that, I studied 4 years of <strong>Computer Science</strong>, where I could improve my skills with other languages like Java, #Net and mainly web-related technologies.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In my professional career, I spent 6 years working for big companies like <a href="https://twitter.com/Accenture" target="_blank">Accenture</a>, <a href="https://www.sydle.com" target="_blank">Sydle</a>, <a href="https://www.avenuecode.com/" target="_blank">Avenue Code</a>, and after that, I founded my own web agency, called Verticis. After 2 years, I&rsquo;ve created my first <strong>startup</strong>, called <a href="https://meuingresso.com" target="_blank">meuingresso.com</a>, that is today one of the biggest ticket-selling platforms in Brazil. During that time I gained experience and passion for <strong>managing people</strong> and <strong>leading tech teams</strong>.</p>
      <p>Today I work in the <a href="https://en.99designs.de/blog/business/berlin-silicon-allee-vs-silicon-valley-infographic/" target="_blank">Silicon Allee</a>&nbsp;as a <strong>senior&nbsp;front-end developer</strong> and <strong>tech lead</strong> at <a href="http://infinitec.solutions" target="_blank">Infinitec Solutions</a>, one of the ventures backed by the giant <a href="https://www.finleap.com/" target="_blank">FinLeap</a>.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I build web apps. My passion is <strong>front-end development</strong>. But I also know how to build performant and modern <strong>server applications</strong> and I have huge experience with <strong>mobile development</strong>. I speak Portuguese, English,&nbsp;ein bisschen Deutsch, <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Node.js.</strong>&nbsp;I believe beautiful <strong>user interfaces</strong> are one of the keys to great <strong>experiences</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If you want to know more, <a href="/contact">please contact me</a>. I&rsquo;d love to chat or have a <strong>beer</strong>.</p>
      <p>Cheers!</p>
