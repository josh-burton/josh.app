{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/nogueira_hugo/workspace/hugomn/hugomagalhaes.com/src/pages/blog/my-personal-mission-statement.en.md","html":"<p>After reading the book “The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People”, written by S. Covey, I understood the real importance of having a clear vision of my personal mission, as a way to always seek to understand if my daily attitudes and achievements are in agreement with my long-term goals. And it serves as a guide so that all my steps, even if the most daily, are in accordance with what I want in the future. Here is my personal mission statement:</p>\n<p>I will always seek to balance my career and my personal life since both are vitally important to my happiness. Some moments will require a greater dedication, both at work and between family and friends, and I will try to be clear to know how to strike the balance between these moments.</p>\n<p>As an entrepreneur, I will always seek to update myself and make my skills always be used in the search for better lives for people and a better world in general.</p>\n<p>As a tech lead, I will always seek to be considered by my experience and by my examples, not by my position. I will publicly praise and acknowledge. Critical and constructive feedbacks I will do privately and directly.</p>\n<p>As a software developer, I will always strive to deliver the highest possible quality, and always make sure my code is tested, easily understood, and maintainable by other developers. I will always be in line with the best and latest technologies. I will always seek to collaborate with the general community by providing open-source code, and will always try to contribute with other open-source libraries and tools.</p>\n<p>I will exercise wisdom in what I choose to read, watch and do at home in my leisure time. I believe that entertainment plays an important role in our lives, but by no means can I allow it to take much of my time.</p>\n<p>My body is my temple. I will use my knowledge and access to information to choose wisely what to eat and how to exercise my body.</p>\n<p>I value the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities of our democratic society. I will be a concerned and informed citizen involved in the political process to ensure my voice is heard and my vote counted.</p>\n<p>I will be an individual of my own initiative who carries out the initiative to accomplish the goals of my life. I will act on situations and opportunities, rather than being attended to.</p>\n<p>I will always try to keep myself free from addictive and destructive habits. I will develop habits that will free me from old labels and boundaries and expand my capabilities and choices.</p>\n<p>My money will be my servant, not my master. I will seek financial independence over time. My desires will be subject to my needs and my means. I will spend less than I earn and regularly save or invest part of my income.</p>","excerpt":"After reading the book “The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People”, written by S.
